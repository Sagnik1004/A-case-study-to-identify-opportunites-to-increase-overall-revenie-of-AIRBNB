# A-case-study-to-identify-opportunites-to-increase-overall-revenie-of-AIRBNB

Airbnb has seen a significant decline in revenue the past few 
months but now that the covid restrictions are slowly being lifted, 
people are starting to travel once again as the world slowly but 
surely moves back towards normalization.

 Therefore this is a prime time for us to get back into the upswing 
of business again and this study aims to identify opportunities for 
us to take advantage of in pursuit of this goal.

 This study aims to identify which types of hosts to acquire, the 
neighborhoods we need to target, price ranges preferred by our 
customers, most popular localities, etc so that our revenue can 
start it’s upswing sooner rather than later.

To prepare for the next best steps that Airbnb needs to take as a business, we have analysed a dataset consisting of various Airbnb listings in New York. Based on this analysis, we aim to give two presentations to the following groups.

Presentation - I
1. Data Analysis Managers: These people manage the data analysts directly for processes and their technical expertise is basic.
2. Lead Data Analyst: The lead data analyst looks after the entire team of data and business analysts and is technically sound.

Presentation - II
1. Head of Acquisitions and Operations, NYC: This head looks after all the property and host acquisitions and operations. Acquisition of the best properties, price negotiation, and negotiating the services the properties offer falls under the purview of this role.
2. Head of User Experience, NYC: The head of user experience looks after the customer preferences and also handles the properties listed on the website and the Airbnb app. Basically, the head of user experience tries to optimise the order of property listing in certain neighbourhoods and cities in order to get every property the optimal amount of traction.
